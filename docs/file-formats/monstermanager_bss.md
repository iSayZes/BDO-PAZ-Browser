# `monstermanager.bss` Format

## Purpose

A PABR list of monster characters, each with two u32 values. On client
3482 it holds six rows: three `Black Spirit's Energy` characters
(`21246`, `20900`, `20899`) and three characters named `Test` (`20885`
to `20883`). The second value is the first plus `1000` to `3000` on every
row. What the two values set is open (see Open Questions).

## Field Names

Every key resolves to a LOC type 6 character name, so `character_key`
names the meaning. The file is not in the archives of client 1784, no
sheet or column of a private server's `DataSheets.bexcel` on that client
has `MonsterManager` in its name, and no client Lua on client 3482 names
the file or calls a getter for it. Both values stay unknown.

## Notes

- The handler for the PABR option tables (`_bss/pabr_values/`) previews
  this file with the layout in `_bss/pabr_values/world_tables.py`: the
  character key and name per row.

## Open Questions

### What the Two Values Set

Both values are multiples of `1000` and the second is always the larger,
so a range (minimum and maximum) on a `10000` scale would fit, as would two
durations in milliseconds. The three `Black Spirit's Energy` characters and
the three `Test` characters step through the same `unknown_02` values
(`7000`, `5000`, `3000`). Nothing in the client Lua or UI XML reads either
value.
